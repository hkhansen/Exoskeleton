# Upper adaptable upper-limp exoskeleton
In this repository, the files for creating a user-specific upper-limp exoskeleton can be found. The project was conducted as a master thesis project at the Department of Technology, Management and Economics at the Technical University of Denmark. The department is a part of the European [ReHyb](https://rehyb.eu/) project.
## Structure
- The *Configurator* folder contains all files used for the configurator, including a compressed file containing the executable program.
- The *Control software* folder contains the Python scripts for running the exoskeleton on a Raspberry Pi.
- The *SolidWorks files* folder contains the 3D models of all iterations of the exoskeleton.
- The *STL files* folder contains all STL files for printing the exoskeleton. These parts are adapted to me and will therefore not fit everybody.
